This project implements smart home automation using ESP32 microcontrollers and integrates
cloud services, specifically Blynk, for remote access and control of home appliances. It aims to
develop a user-friendly system that enables monitoring and control of devices from anywhere.
ESP32 microcontrollers act as the central hub, connecting sensors, actuators, and appliances.
Blynk IOT facilitates remote access, data storage, and automation of alerts and notifications. The
integration of ESP32 with Blynk cloud servers allows real-time monitoring and control through a
web browser or mobile app.
